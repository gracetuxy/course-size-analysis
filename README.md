# course-size-analysis

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to explore the environment in which students from different university faculties commonly learn in by examining the classroom settings. This project specifically examines the classroom sizes and instructor gender in the various faculties

## Samping Methods
Using the course list from the UBC Student Service Centre, we used both simple random sampling and stratified sampling methods to collect data on the class sizes and instructor gender for undergraduate UBC courses. The stratas selected for the stratified samples were the four major UBC faculties, namely Arts, Science, Engineering/Applied Science, and Commerce and Business Administration. A sample size of 40 was used for each of the sampling methods to allow for the normal distribution assumption.
